#Surprise Flowers
This little tool traces its origins to a joke-argument between my husband and
me about four years ago, when I was first learning Python. The premise of the
argument was that while he bought me flowers on all of the important special
occasions -- e.g. my birthday, our anniversary, Valentine's Day -- he never
bought me flowers "just because." His defense was that since he loved me so
much _all the time_ he never thought "I love her so much right now that
I'm going to buy her flowers."

I said, "I think I can fix that," and Surprise Flowers was born.

The tool is simple.  It is intended to be run as a cron task on a computer you
use fairly frequently.  It picks a random day of the month to email your
significant other (or, you can set it up to run for yourself!) and on that
day will email a "buy flowers" reminder.
